        <h3>Top 10 Technical Skills for Software Developers in 2022</h3>
        <div class="text1"><a href="#">Before we begin the list of key technical skills a software developers should have in 2021, we want you to know that each of these are learnable skills. No item on this list is out of reach for you if you are willing to put in the efforts to master them.
          <p> Now, onto the list.</p></div>
        <ul class="list1">
          <li>
            <div class="count">1</div>
            <div class="extra_wrapper">
              <div class="text1"><a href="#">Data Structures and Algorithms: </a></div>
              Data Structures and Algorithms are two of the most non-negotiable technical skills most tech companies look for when hiring software developers. Because your efficiency in Data Structures and Algorithms is directly related to your problem-solving ability and coding skills. 
Software developers often fail to understand the importance of Data Structures and Algorithms in the early stages of their careers. But as you progress in your career, you’d realize how important it becomes when your code starts taking too much time or too much memory in the system.
Data Structures and Algorithms are also a crucial part of any software developer interview, so it’s important you continue upgrading your DS and Algorithm skills such as arrays, linked lists, and trees.</div>
          </li>
          <li>

            <div class="extra_wrapper">
              <div class="text1"><a href="#">Cloud Computing </a></div>
              Companies, small and large, and from various domains are now moving toward cloud services as they provide cost-effective infrastructure with improved scalability and flexibility options. This means any company you work for, will eventually move to cloud if not already, and expect you to be able to work with cloud-based applications.
Being familiar with and having hands-on experience in any of the top cloud platforms like Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud Platform will give you a great edge over others, especially during interviews.</div>
          </li>

            <div class="extra_wrapper">
              <div class="text1"><a href="#">Git and GitHub </a></div>
              As a software developer, you need to know about version control tools like Git and SVN. Git and GitHub have streamlined the market to a great extent. Over 70% of the companies use Git. 
When learning Git, make sure you put some effort into understanding the advanced version control concepts such as branching and merging, as well as learning the command line and the GUI.</div>

            <div class="extra_wrapper">
              <div class="text1"><a href="#">Containers (Docker and Kubernetes) </a></div>
              Docker and Kubernetes are some of the most important container tools every software developer is expected to know. Containers help developers test their applications in a unified environment but also make the deployment process easier. Docker and Kubernetes are two containers that’ll help you get the edge in any software developer interview since they are one of the most sought-after skills companies look for in 2021.</div>

              <div class="text1"><a href="#">IDEs (VSCode or IntelliJIDEA) </a></div>
              Modern IDEs such as Visual Studio Code or Eclipse is a critical tool for any programmer. VS Code is a great option for any C/C++/C# programmer, whereas for Python developers, the Jupiter Notebook is a good choice.</div>

              <div class="text1"><a href="#">Database and SQL </a></div>
              Due to the popularity of the database, it’s expected from every programmer that you’re familiar with essential database concepts like normalization and table design along with SQL. You may choose to learn any one of the popular databases such as Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, or PostgreSQL. It’s the familiarity that matters. You should be able to perform functions like insert/update/delete data and write SQL codes to retrieve it.</div>

              <div class="text1"><a href="#">Linux (UNIX) </a></div>
              Most software developers nowadays work on UNIX systems. Therefore, understanding the Linux command line goes a long way in helping you work efficiently. You can perform basic tasks and know what’s going on with the system by checking its CPU or memory usage.</div>

              <div class="text1"><a href="#">Object-Oriented Programming </a></div>
              As a software developer, you need to know at least one of the following programming languages —  C, C++, C#, Java, Python, or JavaScript. The easiest to learn, however, is the Java programming language. Related read: We had written a post about the popular programming languages to learn for FAANG interviews. Do read it if you are not sure about which programming language you should learn and master.</div>

              <div class="text1"><a href="#">Computer Networks </a></div>
              Any software application you develop will never be standalone. They will be interconnected via computer networks. This makes understanding computer networks important to develop and support your application.</div>

              <div class="text1"><a href="#">Scripting </a></div>
              Scripting languages make it easier to create tools and scripts to solve frequently occurring programming problems.
If you have a good grasp of scripting languages such as Python, you can easily automate the most mundane tasks. Python is also one of the languages that you can use for both OOP coding and scripting. This is a classic example of killing two birds with one stone..</div>
